I've made several improvements to optimize the code and fix the issues:
Fixed syntax errors in graph initialization:
Corrected the HashMap initialization syntax
Fixed incorrect method chaining
Added missing new keywords
Fixed map initialization using proper Map.of() syntax
Code Structure Improvements:
Added proper DFS implementation that was missing
Organized the code more cleanly with consistent formatting
Removed redundant class qualifiers
Added proper edge connections between nodes
Performance Optimizations:
Used final keywords for immutable variables
Used Map.of() for efficient map initialization
Implemented efficient graph traversal algorithms
Used HashSet for O(1) visited node lookups
Used LinkedList for efficient queue operations in BFS
Added proper error handling and null checks in the traversal methods
The code now correctly implements both DFS and BFS traversals of the book recommendation graph, with proper edge weights and connections. The graph structure is properly initialized with all the book titles and their relationships.
