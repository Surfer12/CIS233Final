Alice is an avid reader with varied tastes. She finds that when she loves a book, she often enjoys books with similar themes, authors, or writing styles.

Alice recently finished and loved "The Clockwork Dragon".
"The Clockwork Dragon" has thematic connections to "Whispers of the Ancients", "The Sunken City", and "The Starfire Codex".
"Whispers of the Ancients" is similar in style to "The Forgotten King" and "Echoes of the Past".
"Echoes of the Past" shares an author with "The Obsidian Tower" and "The Crimson Labyrinth".
Separately, the library also has other books "The Wandering Woodsman", which shares an author with "The Hidden Valley" and "Songs of the Forest".
Write a Java program to model these relationships and identify all the books Alice might enjoy based on her love for "The Clockwork Dragon".
