// Correct BFS and DFS

Starting from node A, perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) and a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on the graph below. List the nodes in the order they are visited for each traversal

Depth-First Search (DFS):
Nodes visited in order: A, B, D, B, C, E, C, F, G, F, I, H, I, J, K
Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Nodes visited in order: A, B, D, B, C, E, C, G, F, I, H, I, J, K
