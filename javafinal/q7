// Wrong shortest path...



Find the shortest path from node 0 to node 4. Briefly explain your process.

To find the shortest path from node 0 to node 4, we need to use the Dijkstra's algorithm.

Step one is to initialize the distances of all nodes to infinity, except for the source node, which is set to 0.

We asses all the neighbors of the source node, and the subsequent nodes and asses their current distances and add them to a distance array to understand the shortest distance to each node in the graph

0 > 1 : Distance of four

0 > 7 : Distance of eight

and so on,

Then we will find through the traversal of the graph through each node, that each node has a set "distance" from node 0.

These are our final shortest distances to each node.

We then look at this distance array and see what our shortest path to node 4 is.

0 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4. Distance 8 + 1 + 2 + 10 = 21
